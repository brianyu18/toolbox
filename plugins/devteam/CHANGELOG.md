# Changelog

## 1.5.0 — 2026-07-24 — /relay baton-pass (graduated)

### Added
- **`/relay`** — pass the current mission to a FRESH session as a *baton* (a relay leg, not a
  resume): mission lifecycle (mint/append/complete with `--done` + judged completion), a
  Relay block appended to the checkpoint, a collision-immune baton in the mission's
  `named/<mission_id>.md` slot, an append-only `relay.json` trail (mission_id, goal,
  definition-of-done, per-leg outcome/next), and a secret-scrubbed in-repo `.relay/` mirror
  (gitignored by default; interactive-only consent to commit). Graduated from claude-sync
  after the stability gate: 7-item council hardening, a live manual pass on a real 24h
  mission, and the agent-os kernel's automated button-pass verified end-to-end 2026-07-23.
- **`/continue` mirror-fallback (cross-machine baton read).** When a repo has no local
  checkpoint dir (fresh machine), `/continue` now falls back to `.relay/baton.md` +
  `.relay/relay.json` in the repo — both the bare and `<mission_id>` forms. Local
  checkpoints remain canonical; the mirror fires only on a local miss.

### Changed
- **`/checkpoint` + `/continue` slug resolution** now prefers the git toplevel
  (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, falling back to `pwd` outside a repo) so saves from a
  subdirectory land in the same slug `/relay` and `/continue` read. Backward compatible:
  non-repo projects resolve exactly as before; repo sessions run at the toplevel resolve
  to the same slug as before.

### Notes
- **Dependency inversion (council design):** the relay's durability CORE is the plugin's own
  checkpoint. Brain/vault layers (the claude-sync `fullsave` stack) are an OPTIONAL
  enhancement — detected at run time, never required; the skill degrades to checkpoint-only
  with an honest report line. The devteam plugin remains brain-agnostic.
- **Automation contract:** external automation (the agent-os kernel) injects
  `/relay --attempt <id>`; the skill echoes the attempt id in the leg it writes — that echo
  is the completion handshake. The relay.json schema is read fail-closed by `agent_os.relay`;
  keep them in lockstep (schema stated inline in the skill's step 5).
- Backward compatible — purely additive (new skill + command; the continue fallback only
  fires where it previously dead-ended with "No checkpoint").

## 1.4.1 — 2026-06-20 — /startup guided goal-intake

### Added
- **Goal-intake for bare `/startup`.** Invoking `/startup` with no goal (and no `--goal-file`) no longer dead-ends — it runs a short main-thread Q&A that co-authors a goal, with an opt-in `council --lite` deferral ("I'm not sure — help me shape it") that proposes 1–3 candidate goal directions from your answers + repo/vault context. The assembled goal is written to `GOAL.md`, then flows into the existing CONTRACT phase.

### Notes
- Default Q&A path costs 0 dispatches; the unsure→council-lite path costs ~5 (counted toward the budget, opt-in).
- No change when a goal IS provided (inline or `--goal-file`). Backward compatible.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-06-19 — /startup autopilot + frontend-specialist

### Added
- **`/startup`** — autonomous project autopilot. Takes a goal, approves a one-screen CONTRACT (via `council --lite`), then drives THINK→DESIGN→PLAN→BUILD→REVIEW→TEST in autonomous mode, deciding via council-lite and tapping you only on escalation gates (breaking, monetary, security, token-budget, destructive). Stops at the ship boundary. Interrupt anytime (message or `.devteam/control` file) to inject decisions, redirect, or stop.
- **`frontend-specialist` agent** — UI/frontend builder subagent that embodies presto's taste skills (emil-design-eng, impeccable, imagen-direction) and consumes DESIGN-phase artifacts. Dispatchable by both `/lead` and `/startup` for UI partitions.
- **presto integration** — when a goal is UI/presentation work, startup runs a main-thread DESIGN phase (presto `/magic`) before BUILD and a `/design-audit` at REVIEW. presto is an optional dependency.

### Notes
- Token budgeting is a dispatch-count proxy (default 40 dispatches / fan-out 4), not real token metering.
- Every presto image-generation batch (paid Gemini API) hits the monetary gate.
- Backward compatible — no existing agent, skill, command, or state file changed (only `dispatch-recipes.md` gained an additive UI-partition note).

## 1.3.0 — 2026-06-13 — /council deliberation skill

### Added
- **`/council`** — convene a deliberation council that pressure-tests a question, decision, or proposal and returns one reasoned verdict. Reuses existing specialists (2 neutral `investigator`s, 2 `explorer`s arguing FOR, 2 `critic`s arguing AGAINST, 2 adaptive reviewers, 1 mandatory `synthesizer`), plus an optional divergent `explorer`.
- **`reasoning-reviewer` agent** — read-only reviewer of argument quality (logical fallacies, unstated assumptions, evidence gaps, internal inconsistency). Used as the council's abstract-mode reviewer seat.

### Notes
- Council is ephemeral by default (runnable from any repo or none); it logs to `.devteam/state/` only when that directory already exists.
- Backward compatible — no existing agent, skill, command, or state file changed.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-05-30 — Rename /save → /checkpoint (BREAKING)

### Changed (BREAKING)
- `/save` command renamed to `/checkpoint` to match conventional naming intuition: `/checkpoint` reads as "one of many recovery points per session," which matches devteam's per-cwd rolling-history function. The name `/save` is reserved for the singular canonical project state, which lives at the user/brain layer (in a personal Obsidian vault).
- Storage path `~/.claude/devteam/saves/` → `~/.claude/devteam/checkpoints/`.
- Hook scripts: `save-autosave.sh` → `checkpoint-autosave.sh`, `save-reminder.sh` → `checkpoint-reminder.sh`.
- Env var override: `DEVTEAM_SAVES_HOME` → `DEVTEAM_CHECKPOINTS_HOME`.

### Migration for upgraders
1. After installing 1.2.0: `mv ~/.claude/devteam/saves ~/.claude/devteam/checkpoints` (one command — preserves all existing content).
2. Re-run `/lead-setup` to register the renamed hook paths in `~/.claude/settings.json`. The setup is idempotent; old `save-*.sh` hook entries should be removed manually if present.
3. Existing `latest.md` frontmatter fields (`saved_at`, `saved_by`) are unchanged — these are generic timestamp fields, not skill names.

### Why this rename
Devteam's `/save` and the user's personal cross-tool memory layer (brain vault) BOTH wanted the `/save` name. Conventional intuition resolves the conflict: "save" is the singular canonical state (brain layer), "checkpoint" is one of many per-session recovery points (devteam layer). This rename makes the two layers coexist cleanly.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-05-30 — Save/continue session state management

### Added
- `/save [name?]` — capture session state as a curated savepoint at `~/.claude/devteam/saves/<slug>/latest.md` with optional decisions sidecar. Layered design (~1500 tokens main + ~3000 tokens sidecar on demand), enforced size caps, rolling 10-entry history, named save slots.
- `/continue [name|latest|list?]` — resume from a savepoint; subsumes the prior `/lead-resume` by surfacing any pending `WAITING ON USER` block and offering to answer it inline.
- `hooks/save-autosave.sh` — Stop + SessionEnd hook with change-based gating (writes only when git HEAD or slack mtime changes) and 10-minute clobber protection against fresh explicit saves. Prints `📦 autosaved` on write.
- `hooks/save-reminder.sh` — Stop hook mirroring handoff's pattern: nags once per session when commits land without a `/save` since `.last-explicit` marker.
- `hooks/session-start.sh` — extended to surface existing saves on session entry (`📌 Save exists for this project ...`).

### Removed
- `/lead-resume` — functionality folded into `/continue` (which auto-surfaces pending blocks).
- `/lead-abort` — functionality folded into `/save` (saving is the gravestone; no consumer left for `.last-phase=aborted`).

### Changed
- `/lead-setup` now registers Stop and SessionEnd hooks in addition to SessionStart. Existing setups remain idempotent — re-running picks up the new hook registrations.
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` version bumped 1.0.1 → 1.1.0.

### Migration notes
- Existing devteam users: run `/lead-setup` to register the new hooks (idempotent).
- claude-sync users on `/handoff` and `/continue-work`: those still work; deprecation lands in claude-sync after a 2-week / 15-session validation period with the new devteam commands (Phase 4).

## 1.0.1 — 2026-04-28 — Per-agent model selection

### Added
- **Per-agent `model:` defaults** in all 7 worker/utility agent frontmatter (builder, review-specialist, tester, explorer, critic, synthesizer, investigator). Sensible defaults: `sonnet` for code-reasoning roles (builder, review-specialist, explorer, critic, investigator); `haiku` for mechanical roles (tester, synthesizer).
- **Per-lens `model:` overrides** via new YAML frontmatter on all 6 review-lens spec files. `data-migration` always uses `opus` (high prod-risk work); `security`, `perf`, `api-contract` use `sonnet`; `testing` and `a11y` use `haiku`.
- **`--model <name>` flag** on `/lead` (values: `sonnet | opus | haiku`). Run-level override for all worker dispatches. Persisted to `.devteam/state/.flags` for the run. Skills (THINK/PLAN/SHIP/REFLECT) are unaffected — they run in the main thread and inherit the user's session model.
- **Model selection cascade** documented in `skills/lead/SKILL.md` §5.5 and `dispatch-recipes.md`: `--model` flag → lens-spec override → agent frontmatter default → inherit.

### Why
Without explicit defaults, all parallel-fanout dispatches inherited the user's session model (typically Opus). For complex-tier features that fan out 8–12 workers in parallel, this caused materially wasteful spend on roles that don't need Opus reasoning (e.g., test runners, a11y checklist reviewers). The new defaults route Opus to where it earns its keep (data-migration review) and Haiku to where it's enough (tester, synthesizer).

### Notes
- Existing v1.0.0 behavior is preserved when no `--model` flag is used and no agent frontmatter changes are made downstream — the cascade falls through to inherit, matching pre-1.0.1 behavior. The new defaults take effect on plugin upgrade.
- No state migration needed. `.devteam/state/.flags` is read-only created when the user passes `--model`.

## 1.0.0 — TBD-2026-04-XX — Multi-agent team redesign (rename: toolbox → devteam)

### Major
- **Plugin renamed**: `toolbox` → `devteam`. Clean break (parallel install). Old `toolbox` should be uninstalled before installing devteam.
- **LEAD orchestrator skill** — single user-facing persona. LEAD dispatches workers in parallel via the Task tool directly (no lead-agent middleware; per A1-final, lead-agents removed as vestigial once they couldn't dispatch nested subagents).
- **5 dialogue skills**: LEAD, THINKER, PLANNER (with `/autoplan` delegation in work-together mode and DESIGN.md-aware planning), SHIPPER (chains `/document-release`), REFLECTOR (tier-gated retros + watchlist integration).
- **7 worker agents**: BUILDER, review-specialist (with 6 lens spec files: security, perf, testing, a11y, data-migration, api-contract), TESTER, plus 4 utility agents (EXPLORER, CRITIC, SYNTHESIZER, INVESTIGATOR).
- **Two invocation modes**: `/lead` orchestrated + 7 direct specialist commands (`/think`, `/plan`, `/build`, `/review-project`, `/test`, `/ship-project`, `/reflect`).
- **Two autonomy modes**: Work-Together (default) and Autonomous (halts cleanly with notification on hard-blocked questions).
- **Team Slack** — append-only chronological audit log per project. Race-safe via mkdir-mutex with stale-lock detection (POSIX-portable, no flock dependency). Per-actor counters for collision-free IDs.
- **Wave-grouped partitions** — PLANNER produces `plan-partitions.md` with `dependencies: []` and `parallel_safe: true|false`. LEAD reads waves and dispatches BUILDERs in parallel per wave (per A1-final).
- **REVIEW lens selection** — `bin/devteam-pick-lenses.sh` runs deterministic regex over `git diff --name-only` to return applicable lenses (security, perf, testing, a11y, data-migration, api-contract).
- **TEST layer detection** — `bin/devteam-detect-stack.sh --tests` returns test layer names per project.
- **Watchlist mechanism** — `bin/devteam-watchlist.sh` analyzes slack for mechanical signals (`3a-malformed-output`, `3a-tier-flag-override`, `3b-manual-log`); thresholds in `WATCHLIST.md`. Replaces immediate eval/telemetry implementation; tells the user when deferred features become worth implementing.
- **Per-project state** at `.devteam/state/`, **global memory** at `~/.claude/devteam/memory/`, **conventions library** at `~/.claude/devteam/conventions/` (8 stacks seeded: Pine Script, React, Tailwind, Next.js App Router, Node, Supabase, Postgres, Claude Code plugin authoring).
- **SessionStart hook** (opt-in via `/lead-setup`) shows project status when entering a repo with active state.
- **Question-packet contract** with 3 states: `complete | blocked | failed`. Retry-once-then-escalate on failure.

### Backward compatibility
- `/toolbox*` commands preserved as deprecated routers (will be removed in 2.0.0). Five wrappers route to `/lead` with `--tier <name>`.

### Requirements
- superpowers (>= 5.0.0)
- gstack (recommended; optional)
- macOS / Linux / WSL

### Hard rules
- Destructive actions always confirm, both modes.
- Twice-failed specialist always escalates, both modes.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-04-XX — Initial release (as `toolbox`)

- 5-skill workflow router: `toolbox` + `toolbox-{simple,bug,feature,complex}` playbooks.
